I am developing a robust model for the vehicle routing problem with delivery deadlines and limited capacity. 

The robustness means that the routing plan to be developed should be feasible for all manifestations of an uncertainty previously defined in an uncertainty budget. This budget follows was presented in 2003 and 2004 by Bertsimas and Sim.

Currently, my model hedges against one uncertainty each in transportation time and demand, i.e. all scenarios are considered in which one customer deviates from the customer set and one edge deviates from the edge set. 

I would now like to extend the model so that more than this one uncertainty can be considered, but have failed so far. I am therefore happy about any advice.
